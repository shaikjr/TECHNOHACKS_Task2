# TECHNOHACKS_Task2
Iris Flower Classification: A GitHub repo with code to categorize Iris flowers using ML models like Decision Trees or SVM. Dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation included. Great for learning classification techniques.
Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains code and resources for classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The Iris dataset with sepal and petal measurements is used.

Contents
data: Folder containing the Iris dataset in CSV format.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
src: Python scripts for data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
results: Visualizations of model performance and accuracy metrics.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies to set up the environment.
Usage
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore notebooks for step-by-step understanding.
Run scripts in the 'src' directory to preprocess data and train the model.
Check 'results' for evaluation outcomes.
